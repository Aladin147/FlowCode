## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### TypeScript Strict Mode
- Some strict null checks need refinement for production build
- Test files have type compatibility issues (excluded from production build)
- Core functionality unaffected

### Recommendations for Production Deployment
1. Use `npm run build:production` for marketplace packaging
2. Configure API keys through VS Code settings
3. Install Semgrep for security scanning: `pip install semgrep`
4. Enable telemetry for usage analytics (optional)

## üìä Test Coverage
