1. **Extension Activation Test**
   - Install the extension
   - Check VS Code Developer Console (Help ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools)
   - Look for activation errors or console messages
   - **Expected:** Should see "FlowCode extension activation started!" and diagnostic messages

2. **Command Discovery Test**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "FlowCode"
   - **Expected:** Should see at least these diagnostic commands:
     - `FlowCode Diagnostic: Diagnostic Test`
     - `FlowCode Diagnostic: Diagnostic Webview`
     - `FlowCode: Test FlowCode`

3. **Basic Command Execution Test**
   - Run `FlowCode Diagnostic: Diagnostic Test`
   - **Expected:** Should show success message and no errors

4. **Webview Functionality Test**
   - Run `FlowCode Diagnostic: Diagnostic Webview`
   - **Expected:** Should open a styled diagnostic panel with tests

5. **Output Channel Check**
   - Open View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí Select "FlowCode Diagnostics"
   - **Expected:** Should see detailed diagnostic logs

### **STEP 2: IDENTIFY SPECIFIC FAILURES**
If Step 1 tests fail, document:
- Which commands are missing
- What error messages appear
- Console errors in Developer Tools
